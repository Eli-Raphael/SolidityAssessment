# MyToken Contract

## Description

The MyToken Contract is a Solidity smart contract designed to create a basic ERC-20-like token on the Ethereum blockchain. 

### Executing program

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. 

Go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/ then create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension.

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.4" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile HelloWorld.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, click "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "MyToken.sol" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.
